How about population mobility and population density?
As for vaccines, can we consider the vaccination ratio and vaccine efficiency?
Temperature may also be one of the variables that can be considered. 
(If the countries we study are in different longitudes and latitudes, 
and the annual average temperature varies greatly. I mean, temperature may affect viral activity.)
However, I'm not sure whether the data is easy to obtain. If it's reasonable, we can try to find it.
